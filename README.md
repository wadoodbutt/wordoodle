Wordle Game Enhanced

Wordoodle is essentially Wordle except with more options, such as thematic option and different 
lengths in words through Java's GUI. It mirrors the functions of Wordle, such as providing hints through color highlights and using an algorithm to check the user's input to ensure it is valid and 
follows the rules of the game.
